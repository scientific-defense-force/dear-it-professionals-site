# Dear It Professionals

Premise:

1. The world is in bad shape.
1.1 Massive wealth inequality.
1.2 Boom bust cycles.
1.3 Shrinking global middle class.
1.4 The environment is spiralling out of control.
2. The issues are systemic. Thus a new system is required.
2.1 The worst problems are not from criminal behaviour, they are from legal behaviour.
2.2 Left wing socialism has helped with social and welfare issues, but not with the global economic and environmental issues.
3. New alternative systems of governance are possible.
3.1 We have modern technology.
3.2 We have modern scientific understand of humans and the world
3.3 Modern project and team management has developed many new tools for organisation.
3.4 Our current system has been around for 300 years without fundamental change.
3.5 A new system doesn't need to be perfect, it just needs to be better than what we have now.
4. Using open source and continual improvement processes a new system can be developed.
4.1 Open source has shown that a large number of collaborators making small improvements can develop amazing things.
4.2 Technology helps us analyze existing data to help understand better ways to operate.
4.3 A new alternative system becomes great fuel to replace the current system, or to morph it towards something better. The current most touted alternative 'Marxism' is not taken seriously in this way.
