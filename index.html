<h2>Hello first world IT professionals</h2>
<p>We need to have a talk.</p>
<p>I know you have a lot of fun at work and are getting paid quite hansomly. I'm sure you are great at your job and put in a lot of work to get to where you are. However, there is an inconvenient truth.</p>
<h2>The world is in bad shape</h2>
<p>Yep, while we happily work for various companies the world is getting worse. Not just worse in a mild sort of way. Worse in the sense that the future of humanity is uncertain.</p>
<h3>We are greatly damaging the environment</h3>
<h3>We are exploiting the large majority of poor people at an unprecendented level</h3>
<h2>The problems are systemic</h3>
<p>This is occurring legally within global capitalism.</p>
<h2>New a better systems are possible</h2>
<h3>Democracy / capitalism are 300 years old</h3>
<h3>Modern science and technology</h3>
<h2>We can create something with open source and collaboration</h2>
